## Thanks

#### A big thank you to [Chris Hallberg](http://www.crhallberg.com/) for his work on [JSON Against Humanity](http://www.crhallberg.com/cah/json)! Without his work, this team would have to spend hours manually typing the [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) game out (yes, we are fast typers, but no one wants to do that). And of course, thank you [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) Team for bringing out the worst in all of us.
